- 👋 Hi, I’m @Blizzardo1
- 👀 I’m interested in C#, fun projects, and gaming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make a proper game engine that will become a useful asset in developing games fully built from the ground up.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any fun projects and currently, I am working with SDL2-Sharp Project as well as making games and tools I deem useful in everyday life.
- 📫 How to reach me would be more here or Discord @generalkenobi, or [#linux](irc://irc.geekshed.net/linux) on Geekshed IRC.
- ⭐ I now currently hold a Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology from Grand Canyon University!
